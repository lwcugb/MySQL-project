# Advanced SQL: MySQL for E-commerce Data Analysis
This repository contains some assignments and project questions I completed for an advanced online MySQL course.

I analyzed a real-world eCommerce database by writing complex SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to generate actionable insights, strengthening my expertise in web analytics and data-driven business strategy. A brief description of each section:

## 1. Traffic Analysis & Optimization
* Identify top volume and high-converting traffic
* Analyze direct, organic, and brand-driven traffic
* Calculate traffic volume and conversion rates among traffic sources

## 2. Website Measurement & Testing
* Identify top website pages & top entry pages
* Analyze landing page performance & A/B testing
* Analyze conversion funnels to help optimize the customer purchase experience

## 3. Channel Analysis & Optimization
* Explore traffic channel mix, paid vs. free traffic
* Break down performance by device type

## 4. Business Patterns and Seasonality
* Analyze seasonal trends for demand forecasting and planning
* Analyze hourly and daily volume to support customer service decisions

## 5. Product-Level Analysis
* Analyze the impact of the new product launch
* Break down product-level sales and conversion rates
* Cross-sell & product portfolio, and refund Analysis

## 6. User-Level Analysis
* Identify repeat visitors and repeat channels
* Identify our most valuable customers and explore which channels they are coming from

# Lesson Learned
* Think proactively as an analyst to figure out what metrics to use to judge performance for a specific field.
* Use CTEs to perform multi-step “data program” analyses. Map out each step required to arrive at the answer.
* Slice data in segments (e.g., desktop vs. mobile) to continue to look for ways for performance optimization.
* Conduct time-series or trend analysis to monitor the  impact of change (e.g., bid adjust or new page/product launch).
* Leverage MIN/MAX and Inequality Join to identify the first/most recent data points of auto-increment values.
* For A/B split tests, limit periods to where both versions were live to ensure fair comparison.
